--[[
Hello any future TNF scripters if there are any. This AntiTP runs off of tickets.
If a player uses an ingame feature to teleport then they will recieve a ticket.
This ticket gives the player a 1 time immunity for teleporting. After they are
detected, the system will check if they have a ticket, if so it will remove it
and let them by.
